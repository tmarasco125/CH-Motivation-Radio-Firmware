# CH-Motivation-Radio-Firmware
A sketch for the Motivation Radio Eurorack Module (designed by [rheslip](https://github.com/rheslip) and [jakplugg](https://github.com/jakplugg)) that uses the Collab-Hub framework to connect your synth to Max, PD, Unity, webpages, and WiFi-enabled microcontrollers (ESP32) that use the Arduino core.
